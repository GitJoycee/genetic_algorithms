Genetic Algorithms for python
==============

This library hopes to build a wrapper for genetic algorithms to leverage in optimisation situations.
It hopes to make writing infinitely customizable genetic algorithms easy and quick while having all the standard features expected.

Examples
--------
This is a basic example for maximising values in a list, starring with 10 members running 100 generation.
Then it will log to the screen and create a csv file with each generations information.
